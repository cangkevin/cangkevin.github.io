# Clean Code

Robert C. Martin's classic for developers of any experience and background. I believe that any developer that is serious about their profession should have a copy of this book.

There is a plethora of information compiled into an easy-to-read package that will help you establish a solid foundation for practicing the best principles and practices of software development.

# Working Effectively with Legacy Code

Once you've read *Clean Code* and had a bit of experience working with existing code bases, this is another book to have. *Clean Code* will teach you how to write __new code__ that will adhere to best practices and refactor some instances of existing code to meet those practices.

 However, there are other challenges that are often presented in existing __legacy code__ (and quite frankly they are the ones that make our jobs difficult and you will run into them quite often in industry). Knowing how to handle legacy code is a skill that is essential and this book will expose you to all practical advice that you can leverage to hone that skill.

# The Mythical Man-Month

{: style="text-align: center;"}

A timeless classic in the field of software engineering. Read this if you're interested in becoming a well-rounded developer that wants to understand the people-element of software projects.

Having this knowledge will help you understand elements from the management perspective which is invaluable as you progress on with your career in industry.
