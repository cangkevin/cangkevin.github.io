I'm Kevin Cang. I'm currently bouncing around in terms of a home address but you will likely find me somewhere in my home state of Texas.
I was introduced to the world of computers around 2008 when my constant nagging for a "gaming computer" finally paid off, on the condition that I had to build it under a budget. That led me down into a stint where I began building computers under a budget as a hobby.
Not long after, I was weaned onto software development when I began taking Computer Science courses in high school which influenced my decision to pursue it in studies during university.

My career is still in infancy, having only been working in industry for just shy of one year at the time of this writing.
At the moment, my interests lies primarily in things back-end, distributed systems, and object-oriented programming.

# What's with the blog?
I wanted to find a way to keep track of all the things I have learned as I go throughout my career as a developer.
On top of being able to share my learnings and (sort of) establish an online presence, I figured this would be a nifty little project to take on.
Ultimately, I hope that people who stumble upon this will find the content helpful or interesting.
